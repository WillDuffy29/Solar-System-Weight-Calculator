# Solar-System-Weight-Calculator
A beginner Python program that calculates a user’s weight on different planets in the solar system using gravity multipliers. Built to practice variables, conditionals, and user input.

- PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project asks the user for their weight on Earth and allows them to select a planet from the solar system. Based on the chosen planet’s gravity, the program calculates and displays what the user would weigh on that planet.
The project was built as a learning exercise to practice core programming concepts in Python.

- WHAT I LEARNED

This project helped me to practice and reinforce:
- Variables and data types
- User Input Handling
- Conditional Logic (if/elif/else)
- Arithmetic operations
- Structuring a program from start to finish

- TECHNOLOGIES USED

Python 3

- HOW TO RUN

1. Install Python onto your machine.
2. Download this file.
3. Open terminal in the project directory.
4. Run the program.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts.

- FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

I would like to reduce repetition within my code, so I will learn about dictonaries to refactor my logic. 
Invalid inputs (such as non-numerical ones) break the program. I will learn about input validation.
I would like to learn about loops, so a user can re-try if they provide an invalid input.

- NOTES

I am using a website (https://www.codedex.io/home) to teach myself the Python language. This program was built from a provided prompt, but the code is entirely my own.
